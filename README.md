# Dog-Breed-Classification
Image Classification using Transfer Learning in CNN architecture.

Involves data cleaning, preprocessing, data augmentation and transfer learning using VGG.

This project achieved an accuracy of 84.7% in first run.
I lost the output columns during second run due to GPU limitation.
Will update along with requisite output columns in the near future.
